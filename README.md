# Stock-API-Starter-Template
This is code you can use to call a stock API in Python. I leave an example that uses the Polygon API here as well.

Purpose: If you need to analyze stock data, it needs to be organized in a manner that requires minimal "data-cleaning"
The data from this code will produce a data frame in Python using the Pandas library. The data in this data frame is ready
right away for training. As such, you can run any machine learning model on this without having to organize your data. This code does that for you.

I leave an example that calls the Polygon.io API to showcase how to use this code. However, by changing the http parameters and the url you can adapt it for any API.
Also, you can adapt it to extract any type of data from the API, meaning you can tune it to your liking. All of these possible manners of tuning are described in the code's comments.

Thank you for looking at my project!
